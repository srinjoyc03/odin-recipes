    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Improvised Mackerel Burger Meal is a dish made by Sōma Yukihira for Fumio Daimidō's entrance exam for Polar Star Dormitory. In order to be granted entrance into the Polar Star Dormitory, Sōma improvised this dish using nothing but leftover ingredients in the dorm's kitchen. Sōma created a magnificent Mackerel Burger that is both juicy and tender along with an egg soup using some dried squid that he brought as the basis for dashi. Experiencing this meal leaves one with a pleasant feeling, sometimes reminding a person of romance in their youth.</p>
