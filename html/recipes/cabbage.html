    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pepper Mackerel with a Purée Garnish is a dish made by Satoshi Isshiki after Sōma Yukihira's welcome party at Polar Star Dormitory. Satoshi cooked this dish to welcome Sōma into Polar Star and challenge him to an unofficial duel. Using a combination of spring cabbage purée and a perfectly prepared seasonal mackerel, he created a harmonious blend of flavors that embodied the feeling of spring.</p>
